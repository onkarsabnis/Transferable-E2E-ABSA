/ur0WCBz-xTApNh4u1VA_HKNLQ		yMUVflS-2SnOGafXmdHy6w		4		this restaurant is 1 of my very few favorite vietnamese restaurants in phoenix area . <sssss> one of their main selling point for me is the restaurant is extremely clean and nicely decorated . <sssss> also , i never have to wait too long for the order to come out . <sssss> the food is cooked in a way to please a wide variety of patrons . <sssss> i 've seen vietnamese , chinese , koreans and americans . <sssss> even though the pho noodle soup 's flavor is n't as authentic compared to what i have had before , it is still decently good . <sssss> rice tends to be a bit dry , but their sauces and marinated meat are delicious . <sssss> my most favorite dish here is # 22 -lrb- bun bo hue -rrb- . <sssss> it is one of the best in az . <sssss> . <sssss> it is a different kind of rice noodle soup with more texture and flavors . <sssss> those who never had any other kind of vietnamese noodle soups other than pho might not quite enjoy it at the beginning . <sssss> but if you 're adventurous and willing to try a new dish , i highly recommend this one .

/ur0LqgGgWi3FLHBViX9tmZ9sw		1eJiyKXx_ruNu6F36BJQCg		3		it is funny but i still miss the frozen yougurt the way it is served in germany or other countries ... the instant mix -lrb- as a blizzarf -rrb- of a piece of frozen yogurt with the fruit of your choice , cookie , candy , etc. . <sssss> still this place is fine , you can mix the flavors or not and add by the end some extras -lrb- fruit , grains -rrb- . <sssss> the way they charge is by ounce , so watch out when you are loading your cup !

/ur0N1Q6HiZvnZHjNU712Gymqw		3l72FflaaeI0tWEAWN3-gQ		5		this place is a lifesaver for phoenix mexican food . <sssss> i 've tried and tried to find `` good '' sonoran style mexican food and am always disappointed by a greasy mess , up until i stumbled upon ats . <sssss> the people that work here are very sweet and the decor is charming . <sssss> i would describe it as a kind of surf shop meets diner decor . <sssss> it is in a cute older house on 7th , well maintained and colorfully adorned with artsy knickknacks and brickabrack and such . <sssss> the food is very cheap and very simple , you can tell that love goes into every dish . <sssss> a bean burrito is $ 3.25 and very filling . <sssss> the been and cheese concoction that fills it is very tasty but not overly greasy , much unlike many of the other lauded burrito places in town . <sssss> the veggie quesadilla was delicious as well , kind of crunchy from the cabbage or something that is inside . <sssss> both were served with some traditional accoutrement and homemade , wonderful salsa . <sssss> the jewel of my meal here was the white corn on the cob . <sssss> not really knowing what i was ordering at first , i was a little doubtful , but really wanted something more veggie like to round out the meal . <sssss> what came was the most wonderful ear of corn i have ever eaten . <sssss> the cob is a sweet white corn which is then slathered in a slim coat of mayo and dipped in what i think was parmesean cheese -lrb- but was probably the sonoran equivalent -rrb- . <sssss> this was served with lime and a chili sauce that was sweet and spicy and out of this world when doused on the corn . <sssss> what a great little place in a wonderful neighborhood -lrb- maybe my favorite -rrb- of central phoenix . <sssss> if you feel let down by the mexican food that has covered this valley in a layer of tasteless grease , go here before giving up -lrb- also go to mucho gusto in tempe , ats is the cheaper option -rrb- .

/ur0gg_OKjOAl_vVmdh5ZETuiw		FvmZskuhJ9W5_HE3aRtBDQ		4		revolver records is my favorite music shop in phoenix . <sssss> i have never left empty handed . <sssss> the vinyl selection is nice . <sssss> mostly used but there 's a decent selection of new vinyl as well . <sssss> the new arrivals bin always has something in to worth taking home . <sssss> you 'll also find a good selection of used cd 's and dvd 's . <sssss> i do n't always find a lot of what i 'm looking for but most of the stock is generated from locals selling off their collection so it does reflect local music tastes . <sssss> revolver is a good place to check if you 're on the market for a turntable , receivers or speakers too . <sssss> they even have a small used book shelf that usually has some good stuff . <sssss> i walked away with a book about robert williams paintings on one of my last visits . <sssss> revolver records is a great local shop . <sssss> if you like buying vinyl or just checking out the local joints make sure you drop by here sometime .

/ur0APLIPfq1Rf8QyhHHk2uAyA		UI8iKvzhGn2qZCGIqtQqrQ		3		there 's something oddly charming about this place . <sssss> my 2nd experience happened this past weekend - sunday breakfast at 10 a.m. . <sssss> as i pulled up in my car , i could tell the place was quite popular . <sssss> i sensed a wait list . <sssss> i walked in , put down my name and took a seat outside on of their benches . <sssss> the wait was n't long - perhaps 5 minutes - and i was shortly shown to my table for two . <sssss> few minutes later , my breakest buddy showed up . <sssss> we had concluded to call this `` brunch '' since it was a compromise between breakfast and lunch time . <sssss> in any case , breakfast foods were on the mind and my belly was ready . <sssss> coffee first , please . <sssss> the waitress , you could tell , was rather busy . <sssss> i did n't mind that , but i did mind her spilling my coffee each time she poured more . <sssss> her rush was n't coupled with friendly pauses , and i felt like i was more of an inconvenience than a patron . <sssss> in any case , we ordered `` brunch '' and chatted it up . <sssss> it 's not every day i roll out of bed before 10 a.m. on the weekend . <sssss> this was a special occassion ; one well worth it . <sssss> but , sadly , not because of the breakfast . <sssss> the eggs were rubbery and the muffin was hard to swallow without honey . <sssss> the cottage cheese was good , but how can you screw up that ? <sssss> yes , i ordered the hot body breakfast . <sssss> so sue me . <sssss> my friend ordered panckakes with eggs and bacon . <sssss> only half was eaten . <sssss> you know , there 's something oddly charming about this place . <sssss> it 's a warm cafe , reminiscient of a small town mom & pop establishment . <sssss> it probably is , and the fact that it 's thrown near asu makes it the preferred after-hang over joint . <sssss> i can see how rubbery eggs and greasy pork would suit one 's belly after a booze fest . <sssss> but , it 's not ideal for the belly without a drop of liquor coating the stomach lining . <sssss> i used the bathroom , too . <sssss> talk about a tiny walkway stuffed with clutter , like high chairs and cordless vacuums . <sssss> again , it 's charming in a home-for-breakfast kind of way . <sssss> it almost reminds me of shortcakes . <sssss> almost , although shortcakes is in a train car and has , let 's face it , the best after bar and in-the-mood-for-cheap-food appeal . <sssss> sadly , it 's back near osu in stillwater . <sssss> i miss shortcakes . <sssss> harlow 's was n't memorable to me . <sssss> that 's probably why i 've only been here twice in my life . <sssss> sidebar : i would n't call this place `` cheap . '' <sssss> with plates averaging around 8-10 $ , that 's quite the purse punch that should be met with some delicious raves and reviews . <sssss> sadly , to me , it 's not worth the moolah .

/ur0APLIPfq1Rf8QyhHHk2uAyA		CqhsIZ7TzCfJTrZqg5-gqQ		4		4-stars for this simple reason : it 's low key and unpretentious . <sssss> whether it 's tuesday or saturday , there 's room for you . <sssss> it may not be at the bar , but there 's room . <sssss> i prefer this place on a weekday . <sssss> sit at the bar , watch the tv , drink the specials and chat with the bartenders . <sssss> or , play darts on modern-day dart machines . <sssss> it 's comical to play cricket in space , or with balloons . <sssss> if that does n't fancy you , play it straight . <sssss> or meander to the pool tables and hit some balls around . <sssss> or , if you need some fresh air , step outside on the patio ... most often you 'll see a red/blue flashing light show . <sssss> fun times . <sssss> it 's not the easiest place to find if you do n't know what you 're looking for . <sssss> i think the large strip mall across the street distracts you while you 're driving . <sssss> but , turn your gaze to the north side of the street and look closely for this hidden gem . <sssss> stopping in for a drink or two is definitely well worth it .
/ur0APLIPfq1Rf8QyhHHk2uAyA		c0zhbiffge6fGl_Nzgxbqw		5		one of the best places on roosevelt row , made has a plethora of things to catch your eye and keep your attention . <sssss> from funny gifts to thoughtful ones , this store is a gold mine , if you 're looking to please a friend , partner or work mate . <sssss> i mean , if you 're not thrilled by their selection of cool -lrb- and sometimes political -rrb- magnets or buttons , you can always go with the books that 'll teach you all you need to know about urban slang . <sssss> but if it 's thoughtful you 're after , you can find it here . <sssss> from soy candles to handmade purses , you got options . <sssss> i personally loved the baby stuff , the funny tablets -lrb- `` what you should do to make me happy '' -rrb- and the pottery/bowls . <sssss> i can definitely see myself coming back here on numerous occasions when i need to buy a gift for something who appreciate unique , quirky , creative and funny gifts . <sssss> you need to check this place out . <sssss> aside from being interesting and fun , it smells great , too !

'' <sssss> that 's what a t-shirt reads . <sssss> it 's hung up on the wall next to other things , like posters with catchy phrases and local acknowledgments of hap 's being the best bbq around town . <sssss> this place is really just a hop , skip and jump from my office . <sssss> on a rainy november day , bbq sounds superb . <sssss> so , i hop , skip and jump over to hap 's . <sssss> it 's my first time and i 'm curious to see how they do bbq . <sssss> after all , i hail from the south , you could say , and have eaten some pretty great bbq in oklahoma and texas . <sssss> at hap 's around 12 on a friday , there 's a line out the door . <sssss> i agree to wait . <sssss> the wait allows me to check out the decor and patrons . <sssss> it 's mostly men here , and i begin to think , `` what a meat market . '' <sssss> literally , with pulled pork , lamb , chicken , ham and links as your choices . <sssss> but , all i see when i look around are young and middle aged men . <sssss> some are rather cute . <sssss> who knew such things existed in this business area off washington and 48th st. i 'm not the only one with wandering eyes . <sssss> i notice several of the patrons take notice of me , the only young female in the place . <sssss> yep , that 's right . <sssss> i 'm here for the bbq . <sssss> the menu is a bit cumbersome to read . <sssss> there 's the regular menu and a catering one . <sssss> then there 's a small black board with suggested specials . <sssss> i jump at the chance to try their smoked bbq lamb with their mint dressing on the side . <sssss> mint is n't the only dressing option you have , but it sounded like the ideal match for lamb - even the little black board said so . <sssss> so , it 's my turn at the register . <sssss> the woman behind the counter gives me a big , friendly smile . <sssss> i smile back . <sssss> `` i 'd like to try your smoked lamb sandwich with mint on the side . '' <sssss> i tell her it 's to go . <sssss> she punches up my total - $ 5.07 - runs my card and hands me a receipt . <sssss> she also asks for my name , for when you place an order here and it 's ready , they shout out your name . <sssss> not some number . <sssss> not profanity . <sssss> your name . <sssss> very cool . <sssss> well , they did n't have a chance to shout my name . <sssss> while the woman hands me my receipt copy and card , a man leans over the counter . <sssss> `` alicia ? '' <sssss> yep . <sssss> `` here you go . <sssss> enjoy . '' <sssss> i did n't even have to wait one millisecond . <sssss> i snatch up the bag and left . <sssss> it 's not that i wanted to eat there , but if i had , there would n't have been any open booths anyway - just a couple of stools against the wall , nearly in the way of the line of hungry lunchers . <sssss> i anticipate biting into the sandwich and having an `` oohhh '' moment . <sssss> the sandwich is sloppy , pieces of lamp escaping the entrapment of the bun . <sssss> i dunk the lamb pieces in the mint dressing , which is my favorite part of the sandwich . <sssss> do n't get me wrong , the meat is good . <sssss> it just did n't wow me . <sssss> nor did the bun , which is your basic hamburger bun you can buy at the grocery store . <sssss> the sauce was also just okay . <sssss> i mean , i could tell it was bbq sauce , but , let 's face it , it was n't oh-my-god bbq sauce . <sssss> so ... 3 stars for hap 's . <sssss> i can see why phoenix likes this place , for it offers up a plethora of bbq options and sides , including broccoli and cheese casserole . <sssss> or , supposedly , they have a really great cauliflower casserole . <sssss> my friend says so . <sssss> if that 's not your thing , there 's bags of chips , cobbler -lrb- peach , cherry , etc. -rrb- , chocolate nut brownies and even coleslaw . <sssss> so , why not a higher rating ? <sssss> because i was n't wowed by their translation of bbq . <sssss> granted , i ordered one simple sandwich , but even that one simple sandwich , with all its flavor and sustenance , was n't enough for me to deem this place my preferred lunch destination . <sssss> yet , it 's definitely worth checking out . <sssss> -lrb- but , as my friend told me , `` it 's no honey bears . '' <sssss> -rrb-
/ur0APLIPfq1Rf8QyhHHk2uAyA		u0NbikWwP7TVkMkCily-4g		4		art . <sssss> everywhere . <sssss> even in the architecture . <sssss> that 's what i like about the phoenix art museum . <sssss> from fashion to photography to sculpture and the revolving door of special exhibits , this museum has an appeal . <sssss> sure , you may not encounter the rarest of paintings , but you can come face-to-face with a monet , o'keeffe or warhol . <sssss> you can step nose-to-nose with an ansel adams photograph . <sssss> you can get inches away from a slurp and slap of oil onto canvas , then slowly back away until the entire image comes into view . <sssss> to me , that 's the beauty of it , along with your own interpretation . <sssss> some pieces draw you in while others are , to you , more boring than spilled soy sauce -lrb- sart = soy as art -rrb- . <sssss> general admission is $ 10 . <sssss> if you have a kaet passport , you can get a two-for-one . <sssss> even better , it costs nothing on tuesday evenings ... and they are now open free for first fridays , from 6 to 10 p.m. so , there 's no excuses to not check out the phoenix art museum on a semi-regular basis . <sssss> or , if you like it alot , you can even try to volunteer there . <sssss> i 'd say there 's something about an art museum that is relaxing , almost like a slow , tender lull into dreams . <sssss> yet , beneath those dreams are quaking moments of creativity . <sssss> conclusion : phoenix art museum is a terrific way to spend a couple hours .
/ur0APLIPfq1Rf8QyhHHk2uAyA		uL_kqSm8ZqJ_3U88uwA8tw		3		ahem . <sssss> this place turned me off . <sssss> from the parking lot having valet -lrb- and almost no open spot for me to park -rrb- to the cold shoulder i got when i walked in , i felt very unwelcome . <sssss> instincts took me right to where i needed to go , but i got a little overwhelmed when i started to read the labels . <sssss> gin . <sssss> vodka . <sssss> brandy . <sssss> it 's all categorized here , which is muy helpful . <sssss> but , i could n't find the aquavit . <sssss> that 's when i walked to the counter and asked . <sssss> `` it 's in the back , '' i was told . <sssss> for half a second , i thought he was n't even going to show me . <sssss> but , he did . <sssss> he pointed , `` we have 3 kinds . '' <sssss> then he walked off . <sssss> uhm , ok . <sssss> i guess i now had a 33 and 1/3 chance of getting this right . <sssss> i did n't like those odds . <sssss> nobody wants to drink shabby aquavit . <sssss> i phoned a friend . <sssss> no answer . <sssss> that 's when i thought to myself , `` you can do this . <sssss> go with your instincts . '' <sssss> so , i did . <sssss> at the register , i asked , `` out of the 3 , is this the best to get ? '' <sssss> the man who had shown me to the back wall nodded . <sssss> he was busy on the phone . <sssss> the guy checking me out said , `` he 's our resident aquavit expert . '' <sssss> uhm , ok . <sssss> `` so , this really is the best ? '' <sssss> i tried to joke . <sssss> `` i got ta get this right , '' i said . <sssss> he had little to say , so he rang me up . <sssss> i signed my receipt . <sssss> he handed me the slip of paper and my new purchase and asked , `` is there anything else i can help you with today ? '' <sssss> uhm , is n't that question suppose to come before you 're rung up and given your receipt ? <sssss> yeah , i thought so , too .
/ur0APLIPfq1Rf8QyhHHk2uAyA		ntN85eu27C04nwyPa8IHtw		3		matt 's big breakfast ? <sssss> i 'd say the only thing big about this place is the wait . <sssss> when you walk up to the tiny place -lrb- it looks like a miniature brick block that you 're not sure is big enough for humans -rrb- , you scrawl your name down on a standard piece of notebook paper ... and then you wait . <sssss> not fifteen minutes . <sssss> not twenty . <sssss> more like 60 . <sssss> at least they have free water outside because , let 's face , even in october , the phoenix sun can be brutal . <sssss> peaking inside , you realize why there 's such a wait : about 8 tables -lrb- most seat 2 or 4 -rrb- and about 5 stools at the breakfast bar . <sssss> it 's no wonder ... if you do the math , the average person takes about 30-45 minutes to eat breakfast . <sssss> so , add the ordering time ... the cooking time ... the debit card time ... and you have about an average of an hour per meal . <sssss> the odds are against you . <sssss> but , you put your name down , so you might as well suck it up . <sssss> it 's going to be a big wait for matt 's breakfast . <sssss> so , it 's no wonder the food gets such great reviews . <sssss> you 're ravenous by the time your name is called -- you 'd eat the fake flowers if you could away with it . <sssss> coffee is meh . <sssss> at least they bring ya real cream . <sssss> that 's awesome . <sssss> the decor is minimal . <sssss> it 's said the color orange makes one feel hungrier . <sssss> i really do n't think matt needs to worry about his patrons being hungry by the time they sit down to eat . <sssss> again , the wait is big . <sssss> but , i 'll stop whining about that . <sssss> moving on ... i ordered the daily special - a scramble with mushrooms and fotini cheese . <sssss> it came with home fries and two wedges of cinnamon raisin bread . <sssss> it looked very good when it arrived . <sssss> one bite of the scramble and i thought , `` i could have made this . '' <sssss> the home fries were bland ... nothing like kerby lane 's in austin , texas -lrb- if you 've ever been , you know what i 'm talking about ... please , somebody wipe the drool from my face ... -rrb- . <sssss> the redeeming piece was the bread . <sssss> granted , it 's not the best bread i 've had , but it was pretty yummy . <sssss> i made sure to finish all that off , but i left 1/2 my scramble and all but a couple bites of my home fries behind . <sssss> as for the service , is was above average . <sssss> not extraordinary , like i somehow expected from a place like this that boasts the cozy feel of eating among friends . <sssss> the service was prompt , though , and the people working were friendly and seemed to be in a chipper mood -- that 's hard to imagine when you 've been on your feet since before 6 a.m. with a consistent rush . <sssss> one of the cute waitresses even made people outside laugh with , `` we accept all kinds of payment . <sssss> cash . <sssss> credit . <sssss> check . <sssss> or you can work in the kitchen for a little bit . '' <sssss> i thought her happy-go-lucky attitude was a breath of fresh air . <sssss> in conclusion ... walking away from the tiny place , i commented , `` i 'm pretty sure i wo n't be going back there . '' <sssss> from all the great reviews i 've read , i had to try this place . <sssss> i 'm glad i did ... it was definitely an experience , especially since the police showed up to deal with some next door squabble/drug bust/whoknowswhat . <sssss> at least while i was waiting , i had free entertainment to occupy my time .

/ur0VqSCQCva71Q-ZVcMsYfQuw		s9XNBJAZ3ZcNW5u8BRZXuw		3		this is a busy place with an inexperienced waitstaff . <sssss> the restaurant is located a pretty good hike from mainstream scottsdale , so the advantage is little , to no tourists . <sssss> the servers are covering a lot of tables and the menu is extremely broad , maybe too broad for the kitchen . <sssss> it seems they are southwest , but there 's no rhyme or reason behind the pizza 's and other items on the menu . <sssss> i tried a combo plate and thought this was ok . <sssss> the tamale was a bit dry but the tenderloin relleno was really good . <sssss> reasonable prices , good food , ok ambiance and fair service .

'' <sssss> we walked into the smell of fresh paint and a really friendly new owner apologizing that we were here too early . <sssss> he was unaware the az republic ran the article , but happy that we are definitely coming back as the maui spot , named for the original owner 's cat , is really incredible . <sssss> coconut is already painted on the wall and the surfboard shaped tables fill the restaurant which is larger than it 's maui parent . <sssss> the kihei favorite opens its first mainland location thursday 4-4 at the corner of n scottsdale rd and bell in scottsdale , az !

'' <sssss> each succulent bite reminded me of how simple ingredients in expert hands can be so fulfilling . <sssss> grilled broccoli , meyer lemon aioli and crispy onion -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- is one of the sides . <sssss> the smokiness of the slight char on the broccoli is alluring and adds an exotic dimension to something that would otherwise be ordinary . <sssss> badman 's desserts are handled with as much love and care as the rest of our experience , which made them all the sweeter . <sssss> topped with whipped cream and finished with a grating of nutmeg , each joyous spoonful of the butterscotch pudding -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- brought comfort and delight . <sssss> looking into the kitchen , i could see plumes of smoke in the air as a ramekin filled with mint chocolate creme brulee -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- was getting seared with an iron . <sssss> it all made sense as burning sugar filled the air , like roasting marshmallows at a campfire . <sssss> it 's one of those things you long to come back to -- home .

<sssss> created by two local chefs , jared porter and jerry alday , the duo has seemed to have created a delectable menu based on their own experiences using fresh local and seasonal ingredients . <sssss> there is definitely a sense of this commitment walking up the path to the entrance . <sssss> they have many of their own herbs , vegetables and citrus growing right there in planter boxes . <sssss> i even noticed several eggplants growing which i hope to be lucky enough to try on an upcoming visit . <sssss> while the menu is pizza centric , there is also a varietal of sandwiches , salads and pasta . <sssss> for the kid-set there is a section just for the younglings to choose from . <sssss> aside from mac and cheese , this part also includes a b.l.t. for the more sophisticated baby-foodie , how cool is that ? <sssss> looking at a great package i like to allow myself to enjoy other more subtle parts of the package , in this case the balls . <sssss> arancini -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- which are big and satisfying balls of creamy risotto , deep fried then served on a bed of pomodoro sauce . <sssss> these are some of the tastiest balls i 've had in ages and are a must when ordering . <sssss> having a similar impact is the cauliflower gratinata -lrb- $ 7 -rrb- that uses cauliflower mixed with aged white cheddar cheese and topped with breadcrumbs then roasted . <sssss> basically a cauliflower au gratin , it 's a delight to scrape some of the baked cheese off the side of the dish and spread onto a slice of grilled bread . <sssss> for something a little bit different , the eggplant cannelloni -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- uses slices of tender eggplant in place of pasta . <sssss> the slices are still stuffed with cheese and served on top of parlors wonderful pomodoro sauce sans the heaviness usually associated with pasta dishes . <sssss> on the lighter side , salads are done very well and almost all come in 2 sizes depending on your appetite . <sssss> on one visit parlor was actually offering a salad special that was composed of shaved cabbage , queen creek olives , sliced cucumber , cherry tomatoes and cubes of fresh avocado with a refreshingly addictive oregano vinaigrette -lrb- $ 9.50 -rrb- . <sssss> in a similar preparation , the on menu parlor insalata -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- showcases some of the freshest veggies with the addition of crispy chickpeas and salami which both add a heartier dimension to this robust salad . <sssss> while the heat coming from the wood-burning oven could n't be felt , you can imagine the waves of sultry wind as your face closes in on the best part of the package . <sssss> coming in at 8 '' and 12 '' sizes , you can have it a few different ways , your way or the chef 's way . <sssss> though why limit yourself to just 8 '' when you can have 12 '' , right ? <sssss> the 12 '' is plenty to share between 2 diners with decent appetites since the crust is light and thin . <sssss> the wood burning oven and the chefs do a great job of combining the perfect yin and yang of slight char and crispy golden perfection , parlor has some seriously great crust ! <sssss> yukon gold potato -lrb- $ 10 / $ 14 -rrb- is so simply built its near perfect . <sssss> roasted potato , gorgonzola cheese , leeks and pancetta has that sort of down home accessibility you might actually finish a whole one by yourself . <sssss> desserts are treated with much thought here but are kept simple and satisfying . <sssss> seasonal fruit skillet -lrb- $ 7.50 -rrb- was much like a fruit crisp that mom would make . <sssss> made with the tastiest fruit then topped with a layer of pastry and baked until just right , was only made better with a scoop of vanilla ice cream . <sssss> taking my time with each bite , savoring the quality and preparation , it 's the smaller moments in life that can be so memorable . <sssss> so when you get a chance go ahead , take a peek at that package , you 'll never know what you might find unless you look .

/ur0lPaYMDmJbAnv_3pmZH_inw		-AAig9FG0s8gYE4f8GfowQ		5		yay dinner !!! <sssss> it 's no big secret that i 'm a huge fan of chris bianco . <sssss> his simple honest to goodness approach to food is not only inspiring but down right delicious . <sssss> if you 're one of his fans who do n't mind waiting 4 hours for one of his amazing pies at pizzeria bianco , then you 're in for a real treat . <sssss> while they do n't serve pizza , one of my all time favorites , pane bianco is now serving dinner and no serious wait either ! <sssss> in addition to ordering one of their famous sandwiches , you can expect an ever changing menu of rustic italian inspired plates . <sssss> if you 've been to pane you know the drill , go in , order at the counter then either decide to take your score home , or eat there on one of the communal outdoor tables . <sssss> no wine or beer is served at this time but there is talk of pane expanding into the lux coffee space next door which will eventually offer inside seating and hopefully wine by the glass . <sssss> if all of this goes down , lux will simply move to the adjacent building also getting a larger space . <sssss> for me bianco 's food just screams for a glassed of red wine . <sssss> ordering the crespelle -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- had me really excited due to the unique nature of the dish itself . <sssss> basically an italian crepe made the garbanzo bean flour ; it 's filled with luscious ricotta cheese , hints of spinach then bathed in a slightly sweet tomato sauce . <sssss> it was clear that after the first bite i was in love with this dish , i simply could n't stop though glares from my dining companions made me to relinquish the plate . <sssss> i ca n't sing enough praises for biancos housemade mozzarella -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- , thick slabs of hand pulled cheese is paired with fresh tomatoes , a few leaves of basil , olive oil and a sprinkling of salt , that 's it . <sssss> the resulting texture and flavor is so toothsome and fresh that i 've yet to have another as good . <sssss> the salad comes with bread which i put to good use soaking up every drop of the salads milky elixir . <sssss> served on house made flat bread , the soppressata with aged provolone -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- which also comes topped with a healthy shave of parmesan cheese and slices of roasted onion . <sssss> the pungency from the provolone is a nice compliment to the pork-tastic slices of soppressata . <sssss> bianco is dedicated to local purveyors and for good reason , they make some of the best phoenix has to offer . <sssss> take the sausage with beluga lentils and polenta -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- for instance . <sssss> the sausage comes from our very own schreiner 's fine sausages over on 7th street and let me just say , this plump link had just the right amount of meaty well seasoned punch to compliment the hearty lentils and super moist polenta cake . <sssss> if you 're more of a lighter eater , i 'd suggest the highly flavorful roasted seasonal vegetables -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- . <sssss> on my last visit the pan was filled with long thick spears of asparagus , sweet potato , cabbage , radishes , broccolini and cloves of garlic . <sssss> grab a loaf of their chewy bread -lrb- $ 3 -rrb- and you have yourself a vegetarian option even a meat eater like me would love . <sssss> now if they added pizza to the menu , my life would be complete .

'' <sssss> he said . <sssss> it seems that many people may have the same reaction because during several recent visits many tables sat empty , even on a friday night . <sssss> let me just say , you 're missing out . <sssss> it 's understandable that harley 's has been voted some of the valley 's best italian food for several years in a row the food is delicious , comforting and affordable . <sssss> the sauces are made in house , carrying on a tradition of from scratch recipes dating back from the roman table days , if you can remember that far back . <sssss> owners lynn and mike mcgarry have recently updated the space with new artwork and fresh paint , but the friendliness of the staff is unchanged . <sssss> the food is simple and uncomplicated . <sssss> roasted garlic & cream cheese bruschetta -lrb- $ 8 -rrb- is bread , cheese , garlic , tomatoes and basil , then finished with a bit of olive oil . <sssss> nothing masked or hidden , the flavors of the creamed cheeses and garlic are tasty . <sssss> i only wish that the tomatoes had been ripened a bit longer , as they were n't as tender as they could have been . <sssss> salsiccie alla vodka -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- starts with farfalle pasta combined with sweet italian sausage , roasted red peppers , mushrooms , onions that are tossed in a vodka gorgonzola cream sauce . <sssss> this bowl left me reaching for more of the house made bread to pick up the remains of the sauce . <sssss> when you visit harley 's bistro 's web site you can sign up for e-mails about nightly specials . <sssss> for instance , thursday nights are getting to be known for lasagna -lrb- $ 10 -rrb- , a thick slab of layered pasta sheets , sausage , cheese and ricotta all baked up hot and bubbly . <sssss> if i had an italian grandmother , i 'd hope she 'd cook just like this , comfort and joy . <sssss> available for dinner only thursday through sunday , harley 's also serves a mean hand-tossed pizza -lrb- small $ 10/large $ 13 -rrb- . <sssss> the crust comes out pale , but the chewy texture makes up for the lack of color . <sssss> the many toppings include tender meatballs and juicy sausage , paired up with a choice of sauces , including one of my favorites , creamy alfredo . <sssss> you ca n't go wrong here . <sssss> desserts include the usual suspects , such as cannoli -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- , tiramisu -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- and cheesecake -lrb- $ 5.50 -rrb- . <sssss> after eating so much , we just shared a few selections of berto 's ice cream -lrb- $ 6.50 -rrb- pistachio tartufo and lemon strawberry sorbet . <sssss> i wish that these had been served in a bowl rather than on a plate with chocolate syrup and whipped cream ; some things are just better plain . <sssss> food this tasty should never be forgotten .

/ur0VCK3eQKToEkmu8jdSEbTwQ		cInzGnaFZ3EIItvFXl1MvQ		2		at first glance i had high hopes . <sssss> candles on all tables . <sssss> attentive wait staff . <sssss> live music -lrb- ! <sssss> -rrb- ... but in the end all this just did n't add up . <sssss> the crab wontons were fine . <sssss> strong taste of crab and the sauce was very flavorful . <sssss> the entrees were far too soupy . <sssss> either serve the ingredients with plenty of sauce ... or drown the dish in muck and call it a soup or a stew . <sssss> i ordered the mussaman -lrb- braised beef -rrb- which was quite flavorful , but the dish was a mess . <sssss> it was just pieces of onion , scalloped carrots and tender beef lost in a bowl full of broth . <sssss> i thought i ordered a beef dish ... not a soup ? <sssss> and why scallop a carrot ? <sssss> leave the vegetable alone . <sssss> round carrots are fine . <sssss> choo chee seafood was also ordered , with the same result : lost in a soupy mixture with no substance . <sssss> it took for-ev-er to get our check . <sssss> i almost got up to beg the waitress for our tab . <sssss> it was n't even busy , so it 's not like she was behind . <sssss> with all the attention to the decor and overall look of the restaurant , i 'm a little saddened that the food has been overlooked . <sssss> a pretty high price was paid for a mediocre meal .
/ur0tHz9cWxwSfcP4qRaPIHvww		7U8TYNW4Mvx6m3zexsO0sg		1		i wanted to like this place but the service we experienced here was awful and soured everything . <sssss> it did n't start off bad , we made reservations and the hostess was friendly . <sssss> she seated us promptly in a nice comfy booth and we received a breadbasket with crudités to munch on . <sssss> when our waiter came to take our orders , we informed him we 'd be ordering off the restaurant week menu and he made this face of dismay and haughty superiority . <sssss> apparently restaurant week offended our waiter ? <sssss> this is where it went downhill as from here on out , our waiter had an attitude . <sssss> as a first course , we had the option of salad or soup . <sssss> we asked if we could have caesar dressing on our salad and at first the waiter looked upset that we 'd make such a request and looked ready to refuse but relented and said yes . <sssss> however we found out later that this was an additional charge that he did not mention to us . <sssss> -lrb- extra $ 10 , really ? <sssss> -rrb- the salad was average , nothing to write home about . <sssss> for our second course , both of us ordered the prime rib with creamed horseradish , which was disappointing . <sssss> -lrb- again , when placing our order , the waiter seemed really upset - like we were asking him to butcher the cow and then cook us the meal himself . <sssss> -rrb- the prime rib was average thickness , about half an inch and a rather large portion , but the flavor was lackluster . <sssss> even the horseradish , which my husband loves , did n't help . <sssss> for dessert , i ordered the chocolate mousse and my husband ordered the cheesecake . <sssss> i was n't very impressed with the mousse as it had a citrusy flavor - which was not mentioned on the menu and ruined it for me . <sssss> -lrb- i like my mousse decadent - a deep chocolate flavor . <sssss> this was n't . <sssss> -rrb- the cheesecake was good , but my husband would eat any cheesecake . <sssss> then , we waited . <sssss> and we waited . <sssss> the waiter had disappeared on us ! <sssss> we waited for a good 20 minutes before we saw him anywhere near our table . <sssss> my husband had to flag him down and request our bill . <sssss> again , the waiter looked like we were asking him to chop down a tree , make both the paper and ink , and then write our receipt in calligraphy . <sssss> after a few minutes , he came back with our bill and promptly disappeared again . <sssss> we were shocked to see the extra fee for our salads , as it was n't explained to us -lrb- we would have been fine if it was expressed to us -rrb- but unfortunately we could n't find our waiter . <sssss> obviously we could n't use our credit card -lrb- no waiter to process the card -rrb- and we had enough cash to pay for the meal plus tip . <sssss> this is the first time we ever did not want to leave a tip but lucky for this waiter we felt so unwanted that we just dropped our cash and left . <sssss> we wo n't be back .

/ur0tHz9cWxwSfcP4qRaPIHvww		zofs5Ig8kgvtFyp3ySoSBA		4		i was dying to go to this place after trying their dark helmet cupcake at the cupcake love-in this year . <sssss> it was a moist chocolate cake with dark chocolate frost . <sssss> mmm , i 'm a sucker for anything dark chocolate ! <sssss> the store was relatively easy to find and had decent parking . <sssss> the outside is n't much - it 's located in a strip mall shopping center . <sssss> when first entering the store , i was shocked to find not only did they have cupcakes but they had ice cream as well . <sssss> i was a little disoriented and tried to find where the cupcakes were being displayed -lrb- to the left -rrb- . <sssss> they had a lot of flavors out - probably around 15 or more . <sssss> i knew that i wanted to dark helmet , so i let my husband decide upon his flavor -lrb- 24 karat - a carrot cake with cream cheese frosting -rrb- . <sssss> the employee was really nice and patient while my husband decided and asked if we 'd be enjoying them here or to go . <sssss> we took them to go and were happily on our way . <sssss> the dark helmet was what i remembered - moist and delicious . <sssss> the batter had chocolate chips in it , which makes no difference to me . <sssss> i did n't think they added to the overall chocolate flavor and might prefer it without them . <sssss> my husband liked his 24 karat . <sssss> it was moist and flavorful as well . <sssss> -lrb- i really liked the frosting ! <sssss> -rrb- overall , they were good but probably not the best i 've had . <sssss> also , the price was n't too bad , around $ 3 per cupcake . <sssss> however , for the taste and price , urban cookies still takes first place in my book . <sssss> i definitely would n't go out of my way to come back , but if i 'm ever back in the area , i might stop by .
/ur0tHz9cWxwSfcP4qRaPIHvww		OOCLVeqqMFfSnKa7liv0Kw		4		tempe marketplace is one of the nicer malls/outdoor malls in the metro phoenix area . <sssss> i remember when it first opened and how nice it was with a wide variety of new things to eat and places to shop at . <sssss> while some of the restaurants and shops have changed , tempe marketplace has stayed well-kept and all around a great place to go to meet with friends/family for food , shopping , and entertainment . <sssss> i like coming here on the weekends to enjoy a movie . <sssss> sometimes i 'll grab a bite to eat before or after . <sssss> sometimes i 'll go shopping . <sssss> either way , it is one of the nicer shopping destinations and i 'd recommend it .
/ur0tHz9cWxwSfcP4qRaPIHvww		qSLdUiI2edATC3KBT2zf4Q		4		lunch time and craving thai food but wanting to try something different ... to yelp ! <sssss> i found this gem was both nearby work and had great reviews on yelp . <sssss> they do both thai food and sushi - kind of an odd mix but whatever works . <sssss> from the outside , it does n't look like much . <sssss> once inside , the space is rather large and broken up into multiple sections - sushi bar , dining tables , and booths . <sssss> it is very nicely decorated in hues of brown and gold . <sssss> the light fixtures and such seemed modern as well . <sssss> we arrived a little after 11am , which is when they open . <sssss> there were only one or two other groups in the restaurant which was nice because as our lunch progressed , it started filling up quick . <sssss> we ordered off the thai lunch specials . <sssss> i ordered pad thai and my husband ordered chicken curry . <sssss> with lunch , you get soup , salad , and a side of rice -lrb- jasmine , brown , or fried -rrb- . <sssss> the egg drop soup was delicious ! <sssss> i really enjoyed it . <sssss> the salad was good - just your average salad with lettuce , carrot and tomato . <sssss> with my pad thai i got the fried rice , which was simple but good . <sssss> my pad thai was okay . <sssss> i 've had better , but the experience and everything was really good , so i 'd definitely come back and try other lunch menu items . <sssss> with my lunch i ordered a thai iced tea - it was really good . <sssss> even my husband had to steal half . <sssss> overall , it was a great experience . <sssss> there were plenty of wait staff delivering food , filling up drinks , and all worked really well as a team . <sssss> we 'll definitely be back for lunch and will have to check out their happy hour .
/ur0tHz9cWxwSfcP4qRaPIHvww		jRfdz5voj40P6WS9L54caw		4		my husband and i have been here a few times now . <sssss> we 've enjoyed their bread pudding and s'mores crème brulee on a previous trip . <sssss> the bread pudding was decadent with ice cream smothering it . <sssss> the s'mores crème brulee came with chocolate crème brulee , house-made graham crackers , and dipped marshmallows . <sssss> it was good but excessive . <sssss> definitely a dessert to share . <sssss> my recent trip was to try the cronuts -lrb- or doissants or whatever -rrb- that everyone has been raving about . <sssss> when i arrived , the bakery case only had one butterscotch cronut left . <sssss> i asked the employee behind the counter about some of the other pastries -lrb- they had a delicious looking blueberry tart -rrb- and decided i might as well get the cronut . <sssss> she told me it was the last one of the day - once they run out they are gone for the day . <sssss> i took it to go and enjoyed it later that night . <sssss> -lrb- it tasted like a regular donut with cream filling . <sssss> i do n't get what the craze is ! <sssss> -rrb- overall , the herb box is a great place for lunch and desserts . <sssss> -lrb- either location . <sssss> -rrb- this particular location has become more of a dessert spot for me . <sssss> i love that they have a large patio for both the restaurant and take-away spot .
/ur0tHz9cWxwSfcP4qRaPIHvww		1Ap6ZNCvyLLKHP0wvCk9yA		5		we love visiting the zoo . <sssss> seeing the animals and being able to interact with some of them is one of our favorite things to do . <sssss> the zoo has many exhibits and numerous animals . <sssss> it is really a lot of fun to walk around and experience the different habitats and see the animals . <sssss> all the animals look healthy and happy . <sssss> also , the zoo is well laid out and easy to navigate . <sssss> there are plenty of spots to take a breather or to just sit back and experience the wildlife . <sssss> i love the recent addition of stingray bay . <sssss> we had been to another zoo where we got to feed and pet the stingrays and was really disappointed that the phoenix zoo did n't have that , but then a year later they added stingray bay as a permanent addition . <sssss> it 's amazing ! <sssss> you can pet the stingrays , which feel like wet velvet , and then at specific feeding times , you can purchase food to feed them . <sssss> it 's kind of scary at first , but they are really gentle creatures and it 's super fun ! <sssss> i could spend hours petting and feeding the stingrays . <sssss> if you ever need something to do or want a great experience , definitely visit the zoo ! <sssss> i 'd recommend going when it 's cool out , especially since az gets so hot during the summer . <sssss> it 's no different at the zoo - it 's all outdoors . <sssss> plus , during the winter they have zoo lights , which is really pretty at night .

/ur0tHz9cWxwSfcP4qRaPIHvww		byhwHi0lhYdyY5kSpuqoaQ		3		husband and i went here today on a whim . <sssss> hungry for any lunch and driving down scottsdale rd. we found this place by accident . <sssss> never heard of it before and if the menu was n't appealing , we were going to go to sol for mexican food . <sssss> the menu had lobster bisque and we were sold . <sssss> the inside is vast and very open , with high ceilings , enormous `` chandeliers '' , and draperies . <sssss> everything is burnt yellow and pale orange colors with simple artwork decorating the walls . <sssss> it was nice , but not my favorite . <sssss> looking around , i think we were the only diners under 30 - except for the one baby . <sssss> everyone else was either in their 40s or much older . <sssss> this did n't look like our typical lunch crowd , but we did n't feel out of place . <sssss> i ordered the crab and shrimp cakes with roasted vegetables and hubby ordered the soup and salad - lobster bisque and caesar . <sssss> a bread basket came out , with half a mini loaf of sourdough and 3 pizza slice sized crackers with miscellaneous spices on top . <sssss> sourdough was good - hot and fresh . <sssss> hubby liked the crackers , but i did n't try - too messy . <sssss> the food came quickly afterwards . <sssss> mine was really good - especially the crab cakes . <sssss> only two cakes came on the plate on top of sauce , but there was a heaping vegetable portion . <sssss> the cakes were soft and moist - the crab and shrimp very apparent throughout and delicious . <sssss> hubby 's bisque was good , with visable chunks of lobster . <sssss> certainly not his favorite , but he said he would eat again . <sssss> overall , the food was good , but it was n't spectacular . <sssss> also , later we found out brio is a chain restaurant and for the most part , we try to avoid those and eat locally . <sssss> if in the area again and have a craving for lobster bisque , we 'd eat there , but probably wo n't be back .

<sssss> indian in an arabic grocery ? <sssss> yep , but that 's not where the indian surprises end - stay tuned ! <sssss> the other section has a selection of cheap tables and chairs , the likes of which made even the decor at chino bandido 's look opulent by comparison . <sssss> still , i was quite comfortable with it all . <sssss> we sat down and had a look at the menu . <sssss> lots of familiar stuff , so in order to make a good comparison with other similar places i 've eaten at , i ordered the hummus dip and vegetarian platter . <sssss> first thing that struck me was that the initial babaghannoush plate was very good . <sssss> nothing beats the hummus/bbg from my home town 's `` istanbul on king '' , but i 'm going to say that this was probably the second best i 've had - high praise from me - with lots of oil on top . <sssss> the vegetarian platter was also quite good . <sssss> it came with a side of raita , which was a little odd . <sssss> no , it was n't tzatziki . <sssss> although perhaps it was raitziki , or tzaita . <sssss> the wife took one dip of it and proceeded to exclaim that it was the best raita she had ever had . <sssss> i 'd probably say that 's true - it was just the right consistency , and had unusually large pieces of dill pickle in it . <sssss> no , not cucumber . <sssss> i did my cooldown test with the pita , it did n't get leathery -lrb- unlike chicago gyros ' -rrb- so another thumbs up there . <sssss> i have two minor complaints , though . <sssss> the dolmas were hot . <sssss> i hate hot dolmas , i do n't know who invented the idea but all i 've ever eaten for three decades in oz has been the cold stuff . <sssss> never even knew they came in a heated variety until i arrived stateside . <sssss> perhaps the cold ones are an option , who knows . <sssss> i 'll find out next time i 'm here . <sssss> because i 'm definitely coming back . <sssss> last complaint , the falafels . <sssss> they were n't as good as the greek wraps ones , and actually fairly salty . <sssss> strangely enough , my plate came with a small side of hummus , but it was different to what i 'm used to - it had a yellowish tinge to it whereas typically it 's a kind of off-white -lrb- added pinch of turmeric or saffron ? <sssss> -rrb- and the combo of falafels with it was a little too salty for my taste . <sssss> not enough to knock off a star though . <sssss> the wife had a chicken shishkabob with a giant amount of rice and salad - so much that she was stuffed and her plate did n't even look a quarter empty . <sssss> excellent value for money . <sssss> i had a mouthful of her rice and would give it my vote for the most properly-cooked , fluffy basmati i 've had in a long time . <sssss> we did a once-through in the grocery area before we left and picked up some patak marinades . <sssss> and i could n't leave without a piece of cashew baklava . <sssss> good , not the best i 've had but pretty good . <sssss> they have a couple of kid 's chocolates up the front , the kid enjoyed that in the car despite getting half of it on his pants and the seat . <sssss> the prices are incredibly reasonable . <sssss> i was seeing some things for three , four dollars . <sssss> if it were n't for the fact that this place is almost 50 miles from where i live i 'd eat here every few days . <sssss> why ca n't they open something like this in surprise ? <sssss> we do n't even have an indian restaurant closer than eighteen or so miles away . <sssss> you cenpho and tempe locals should consider yourselves d4mn lucky . <sssss> big thumbs up for haji babas . <sssss> if the owners are reading this , set up another location in the west valley for pete 's sake ! <sssss> i need to go back here and get a handle on the dips and tastes and stuff because evidently these guys are giving their own little spin to middle eastern cuisine , at least as far as my experience goes . <sssss> if i 'm still learning , that 's a good thing . <sssss> next time i 'm going to see what the difference is between their `` pita '' and their `` hand-made pita '' . <sssss> it 's just unfortunate that it 's going to be a very rare treat for me due to distance .
/ur0ZUx-B52hGRhmeUDVukmjrg		kr3EFhoSwbJPrL_e_RD39g		4		we only had a chance to stop in here briefly for june 's milkshake shop but i am looking forward to coming back to try the food . <sssss> the tots look delish . <sssss> ca n't wait to try them ! <sssss> i love the decor of this place ! <sssss> so many fun elements and a great view of downtown .
/ur0ZUx-B52hGRhmeUDVukmjrg		mgllPJA6NQXlJurFWAkqQg		4		such a great dive bar ! <sssss> nice bartenders . <sssss> drink specials daily . <sssss> pool table . <sssss> darts . <sssss> oh yeah ... and best ladies restroom in a dive bar ever ! <sssss> this is how i always sold this place to friends when suggesting we go here . <sssss> then i realized one day that they actually received a phoenix new times award for that exact thing . <sssss> and it 's true . <sssss> you know how it is ladies ... typically at a dive bar you do n't want to have to go to the bathroom unless you absolutely have to . <sssss> here it is a pleasure . <sssss> clean , scented lotion , other important lady products if needed . <sssss> it 's not at all what you would expect . <sssss> also , if you get a chance come here around christmas time . <sssss> it 's like a mini version of coach house with lights and decorations everywhere .
/ur0ZUx-B52hGRhmeUDVukmjrg		G9LwkTSdKOyOGqd5BbuIkA		3		my favorite part about this place is the chips they bring out for the chips and salsa . <sssss> they make their own flour tortilla chips . <sssss> yes , flour . <sssss> the texture is a fun and an interesting change from the typical tortilla chip . <sssss> they do throw in a few regular chips , i think to fill out the bowl and satisfy those who like normal chips and salsa better . <sssss> their salsa is good but i am not a fan of olives in my salsa . <sssss> seems like a odd addition , but easy enough to eat around . <sssss> if you go on the weekend they have a free chocolate fountain between 10am-2pm . <sssss> the first time i saw it i thought it was an odd compliment to a mexican food meal . <sssss> but hey , it 's chocolate ... so do yourself a favor and have dessert first . <sssss> you want to make sure you have room , right ? <sssss> they do offer a free `` buffet '' during happy hour . <sssss> it used to be better and more offerings years ago but it 's still nice to have complimentary food to munch on during happy hour . <sssss> good food . <sssss> standard mexican fare . <sssss> not a huge fan of the enchilada sauce , which i keep forgetting since i typically get a burrito `` enchilada style '' . <sssss> but i keep coming back for those delicious chips and forget i should get something different from my usual .
/ur0tRBC8zo48KbWIJn_hEG4mA		sL4n5lhxqoZ5l0d8gwIPyA		4		the only reason i did n't give them five stars is because now i have a reason to go back ! <sssss> i do n't quite know how to describe this place . <sssss> a treasure a midst the dunlap traffic , a jewel in sunnyslope . <sssss> my guess is they hope to capture the john c lincoln hospital crowd but even if they do n't , they have captured me . <sssss> this is not your ordinary bar food . <sssss> our waiter , anthony , was helpful and attentive and described everything since they do their own beer -lrb- i loved the pale ale -rrb- . <sssss> happy hour food was oysters -lrb- not my thing -rrb- but anthony said they are working to enhance it . <sssss> burgers with fried egg -lrb- my fav -rrb- , pretzel rolls with dipping sauces , shreiner sausage plate . <sssss> we split a flatbread pizza and a side order of roasted brussel sprouts . <sssss> but the kicker is the vanilla malt ... made from the fermented sugar they use to make the beer . <sssss> omg . <sssss> i have been looking for an affordable neighborhood place to relax , eat really good food , nice ambiance ... i think i may have just found it .

/ur0THYIqfnLV54VZ_v2hCfq2Q		EWMwV5V9BxNs_U6nNVMeqw		2		slow service -- i 've noticed this the last couple of visits to fez . <sssss> it took over 10 minutes to get acknowledged by a waiter after being seated and then another 10 minutes to receive our cocktails . <sssss> i actually thought about getting up and walking out as they were not busy at all . <sssss> food came out fairly quickly and was consistent , no surprises or much of any new trends developing here . <sssss> after our food again , it took foreever to get a water refill and a second beer only after we flagged the waiter down . <sssss> for some reason though , he was quick to come around and ask if we were interested in desert . <sssss> maybe he likes offering dessert ? <sssss> it then took forever to get our tab to leave and only after we waved down the water . <sssss> the slow service has been noticeable the last couple of visits . <sssss> this leads me to believe either there is a staffing shortage or a lack of attentiveness amongst the wait staff . <sssss> i 've noticed there was plenty of time for chit chat amongst the staff so i have to defer to my second assumption . <sssss> i thought it was just me that noticed this , but my friend who was with me from out of the country noticed the marked difference since the last time i took him here . <sssss> slow service is going to show up in reduced gratuity , and eventually different restaurant choices as there are plenty in this price point . <sssss> fez management take notice , before you continue down the slope of mediocrity .
/ur0THYIqfnLV54VZ_v2hCfq2Q		TuCAYZ89lP_s6D7Y78xNhQ		3		this was was my first visit to smash em up , bash em up burger . <sssss> the staff was very friendly upon taking my order and was really good about saying about how long it would take for the food . <sssss> i had the classic smash 1/3 pounder and it was good , except it was not done quite enough . <sssss> i found it surprising that they did n't ask me how i liked my burger cooked . <sssss> for $ 10 , i thought they should have asked . <sssss> the food was hot and tasty , i just did n't find it visually appealing for the price . <sssss> for a couple bucks less i 'd rather go to culvers . <sssss> the decor is minimalist and feels very corporatized . <sssss> my friend who suggested the place asked if they actually grilled their burgers and we found out they use 80/20 ground beef . <sssss> that was also a bit surprising but then they seemed a little on the greasy side . <sssss> i 'd come back again , but seems like these places are a dime a dozen . <sssss> this one does not come out on my top five burger places .
/ur0THYIqfnLV54VZ_v2hCfq2Q		JbJDlfcnYiyZRXeHQcAVjg		4		this is a great fast food alternative for chicken lovers . <sssss> the chicken has great taste , the sauce is flavorful and has a southern soulful flavor . <sssss> staff is friendly and the coleslaw is not bad either . <sssss> the box combo is one of my lunch alternative faves . <sssss> this is a great alternative to the usual burger joints .
/ur0THYIqfnLV54VZ_v2hCfq2Q		pjtB4FadDdq_DeyedjDsOw		3		i must be lucky . <sssss> after reading the other reviews , i must have gotten a friendly face service or something . <sssss> actually , when i go to full service car washes i place everything in my trunk . <sssss> i just returned from a trip to palm springs and the volvo had a lot of brake dust on the wheels/rims which is atypical apparently for european cars . <sssss> i ordered the middle of the road wash as my interior was not too bad , the mats needed vacuuming and the windows needed to be wiped . <sssss> i asked the dannys team member if they could get the grime off the rims and he took his finger to check and said yeah . <sssss> i walked in and asked the sales clerk `` the drill '' as i never been to danny 's before and they told me where to wait . <sssss> the wash excellent , all of the rim/wheel grime was gone and the car smelled like cinammon rolls and the interior was very clean . <sssss> i 'm not sure what people expect for $ 15 to $ 20 when it comes to service , but i guess i do n't set my expectations too high . <sssss> the only thing i was not thrilled with was that i did get gas after and after driving out saw i was suppose to receive a cheaper price on the gas by about 20 cents per gallon . <sssss> i suppose i was suppose to inquire on that also , oh well . <sssss> i would try this place again , but i ca n't say i 'm loyal only to danny 's by any means .

/ur0RxfFQxUtSIGYwTKU_rvAeg		bgTB6MgdVQssXhkNJ7qIfw		4		such a good meal . <sssss> recently , i brought an out of town co-worker here for dinner . <sssss> for apps , we ordered edamame and the fried brussel sprouts with ponzu . <sssss> really good apps . <sssss> she and i were tearing up the brussel sprouts . <sssss> for dinner , we ordered the pork belly , tempura prawns and butterfish , scallops roll , and the soft shell crab roll . <sssss> my scallops roll was okay to me but i think it was just my tastes . <sssss> all in all , i really enjoyed the food . <sssss> i also had the mojito with papaya i think ... it was bright pink and delicious ! <sssss> i brought home the pork belly leftovers and my husband was in love ... he wants to go back asap !
/ur0RxfFQxUtSIGYwTKU_rvAeg		ssSeK9MYRCUjoabppekwoA		2		i wanted to love this place . <sssss> i really , really did but really , really did n't love it . <sssss> i did n't even like it that much . <sssss> we took some friends there for lunch today and by the looks of the food , it seemed so promising . <sssss> it is a casual spot where the food it pretty much pre-prepared and being heated in the windows at the counter . <sssss> this restaurant has pizza , salads , pasta , sandwiches , and baked goods . <sssss> i ordered one of the specials , chicken parmesan with a side of penne alla vodka . <sssss> the chicken was so bland that i felt like i was eating boiled chicken . <sssss> as my husband put it , it tasted like diet food but without the benefits of diet food because of the breading . <sssss> the pasta was also weirdly bland and spicy . <sssss> the spicy part really surprised me because i have never had it spicy . <sssss> my husband had the penne alla campagna -lrb- 1/2 -rrb- and another -lrb- 1/2 -rrb- penne dish that we ca n't remember . <sssss> his were slightly better than mine but not by much . <sssss> it is sad that the best part of the meal was the pepperoni pizza we bought for kids . <sssss> would i go there again ? <sssss> probably not . <sssss> for 4 adults and 2 kids , we spent $ 65 which i find disappointing for an extremely mediocre meal . <sssss> i suppose for people that work close by -lrb- it is downtown at central and adams -rrb- , it is a nice convenience but if i wanted italian food , i 'd probably choose pasta bar .

/ur0RxfFQxUtSIGYwTKU_rvAeg		e34tIpveepWkpvOuv_boqw		5		i first reviewed this restaurant 2.5 years ago and boy , time flies ! <sssss> centurion continues to be one of my favorite restaurants . <sssss> easily in the top 5 . <sssss> it has changed a lot since my first review and now added bar maximus . <sssss> you can still order food from the centurion menu at bar maximus . <sssss> i have several favorites on the menu which overall ranges from inexpensive to pricey . <sssss> lately , their hamburg mussels is what i crave . <sssss> it comes in a crockpot with a creamy sauce that you dip your endless , buttery bread into . <sssss> uh , so freaking to die for . <sssss> my 6 year old and i fight over that dish . <sssss> as a matter of fact , we are each going to get our own next time . <sssss> ha ! <sssss> i also love their israeli couscous salad made with feta , salami , chicken , cucumber and a light dressing . <sssss> they also make great pizzas , risotto and dishes from their brick oven . <sssss> try their handcrafted cocktails , too . <sssss> while a little pricy , they are well-made . <sssss> eric also has a really nice wine list for different palates . <sssss> case in point , my husband and i have vastly different tastes in wine and can still enjoy a glass there .

'' <sssss> note to owner , if you are going to have authentic dishes at your restaurant , please train your servers to pronounce your dishes correctly . <sssss> alright , rant aside , i had their red sangria -lrb- not that great -rrb- , their first course grilled shrimp dish that had a really good avocado , guacatillo sauce . <sssss> yum . <sssss> we also ordered the emapanadas . <sssss> i liked them alot but my husband was n't a fan . <sssss> fb fills their empanadas with ground meat and my husband is used to my mom 's stuffed with pernil . <sssss> i thought they were good , though . <sssss> overall , i enjoyed my experience here . <sssss> their menu had a number of dishes i am interested in so i think i will come back again .
